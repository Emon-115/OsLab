August 25, 1991 Dear friend,
I am writing to you because she said you listen and understand and didn’t try to sleep with that person at that party even though you could have. 
Please don’t try to figure out who she is because then you might figure out who I am, and I really don’t want you to
do that. I will call people by
different names or generic names because I don’t want you to find
me. I didn’t enclose a return address
for the same reason. I mean nothing bad by this. Honest.
I just need to know that someone out there listens and
understands and doesn’t try to sleep with
people even if they could have. I need to know that these people
exist.
I think you of all people would understand that because I think
you of all people are alive and
appreciate what that means. At least I hope you do because other
people look to you for strength and friendship and it’s that simple. At least that’s what I’ve
heard.
So, this is my life. And I want you to know that I am both happy
and sad and I’m still trying to
figure out how that could be.
I try to think of my family as a reason for me being this way,
especially after my friend Michael
stopped going to school one day last spring and we heard Mr.
Vaughn’s voice on the loudspeaker.
“Boys and girls, I regret to inform you that one of our students
has passed on. We will hold a
memorial service for Michael Dobson during assembly this Friday.”
I don’t know how news travels around school and why it is very
often right. Maybe it was in the
lunchroom. It’s hard to remember. But Dave with the awkward
glasses told us that Michael killed
himself. His mom played bridge with one of Michael’s neighbors and
they heard the gunshot.
