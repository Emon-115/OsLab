1. Arrival Time-
 
Arrival time is the point of time at which a process enters the ready queue.
 

2. Waiting Time-
 
Waiting time is the amount of time spent by a process waiting in the ready queue for getting the CPU.
 
Waiting time = Turn Around time – Burst time
 

3. Response Time- 

Response time is the amount of time after which a process gets the CPU for the first time after entering the ready queue. 

Response Time = Time at which process first gets the CPU – Arrival time

 

4. Burst Time-
 
Burst time is the amount of time required by a process for executing on CPU.
It is also called as execution time or running time.
Burst time of a process can not be known in advance before executing the process.
It can be known only after the process has executed.
 

5. Completion Time-
 
Completion time is the point of time at which a process completes its execution on the CPU and takes exit from the system.
It is also called as exit time.
 


6. Turn Around Time-
 
Turn Around time is the total amount of time spent by a process in the system.
When present in the system, a process is either waiting in the ready queue for getting the CPU or it is executing on the CPU.
 

Turn Around time = Burst time + Waiting time
OR
Turn Around time = Completion time – Arrival time
 


Important Note-

While discussing the above definitions,

We have considered that the process does not require an I/O operation.
When process is present in the system, it will be either waiting for the CPU in the ready state or it will be executing on the CPU.
